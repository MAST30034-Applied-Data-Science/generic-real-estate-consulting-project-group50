    "Data science in real estate plays an essential role in helping to leverage the decision-making process. It can be used to analyze economic trends to predict real estate performance. Our goal is to find the most important features of residential properties, predict rental prices, and find the most livable and affordable suburbs in victoria with the aid of big data. This notebook is used to summarise our key findings and futher discussions of this project."

We derive the travel distance and duration from the centroid to the nearest public facilities using API. We only get income data from 2016-2019, so we predict the income for the next six years using the growth rate. Outlier detections are also put into effect. We drop the properties with no bedrooms and bathrooms and weekly rental prices greater than 5000 and fill all the missing values to be 0."

A regression model provides a function that describes the relationship between one or more independent\tvariables and a response variable.

So, in the sample way, a random forest regression model combines numerous decision trees."

We chose the number of trees to be 300, the maximum number of features the model allowed to try in an individual tree to be the square root of the total number of features in an individual run, and the depth of each tree in the forest to be 13. A fixed value of random_state is just to ensure the model gives the same results if given with the same parameters."

Weight is the impact that node has on the next layer node. The computer uses a loss function to evaluate the temporary model's performance. Once it has the results, the optimizer improves the model, and metrics demonstrate the model performance."

    "We would evaluate regions by six factors. Safety level/Rent income ratio / Number of bus stations/school/hospital/ shopping center. Since the crime count is not proportional to the safety level, the safety level was calculated by taking the inverse of the crime count per person. The rent-income ratio is not proportional to affordability, so we would also take the inverse. We believe the safety level is the most important factor to consider when we evaluate liveability, so we would only consider the region with a safety level above the median. Moreover, we define rental percentage over 50% of the income as unaffordable. A radar chart is useful for overall assessment through multivariate data. The final performance ranking was measured by radar plot area."
